******Predicting Telco Cutomer Churn******

**Overview**
This repository contains code and resources for a predictive model to forecast Telco customer churn. 
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can identify customers who are likely to churn, 
allowing the company to take proactive measures to retain those customers.

**The Experimental Design**
 Below are the steps taken in this analysis
 1. loading the required libraries
 2. Loading and previewing data
 3. Cleaning the data
 4. Univariate analysis
 5. Bivariate analysis
 6. Multivariate analysis
 7. Implementing the solution by using the neccesary analysis(XGBoost)
 8. Challenging the solution and giving insights on how improvements can be made
